## CNN dev Folder:

This folder is responsible for the development and training of a convolutional neural network, to be trained on the generated dataset.

**Model 1:** First iteration of the model, included Bayesian optimization of the hyperparameters, but did not include techniques for schedule learning or overfitting, or data normalization.

**Model 2:** Second iteraiton of the model adds in scheduled learning, overfitting techniques by using dropout every other layer.
